			"The Rubik's Cube is very misunderstood. Most people say things like, \"I just peel the stickers off,\" \"I can solve 5 sides,\" and \"Wow, you must be really smart if you can solve the Rubix (incorrect spelling) Cube!\" These Rubik's Cube) say to sound smart.\n\nYou're probably wondering why this matters. It doesn't. Just don't go around doing these things if you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nAnyway, what is the Rubik's Cube? It's a simple puzzle and configured in many different ways. When it is put into a \"scrambled\" state, it can be extremely difficult, nearly impossible, to solve without any guidance. Luckily, many methods have been created to make this process easier, and now pretty much anyone can solve it, including you!\n\nI'll be going over a method for beginners that is easy to understand, so if you're scared or think you're not capable or \"not smart enough\", don't worry! I even taught my dog how to do it*!\n\nIf you're excited to solve your first Rubik's Cube, that's great! But before we get into how to solve it, you'll have to know a few important things.",
			"*I don't have a dog, nor did I teach him how to solve the Rubik's Cube",
			"First, the Rubik's Cube is solved in layers, not sides. Surprisingly, trying to solve the cube by getting one side at a time makes it much more difficult. This is what a solved side versus a solved layer looks like:",
			"In the solved side, the entire face is yellow, but the parts along its edge don't match up. In the solved layer, the difference is that the colors along the edge do line up.\n\nThat may have been a bit confusing, but don't worry! This idea of solving in layers is built into this tutorial, so it will happen naturally. Also, here's some quick nomenclature that I'll be using to identify certain pieces:",
			"Lastly, you need to learn about turning notation. Each of the six sides has a letter representing it, and indicates a turn to that side. It should be turned clockwise from the perspective of that side. Note that while doing the following turns, the leftmost of the three sides shown should point towards you.",
			"These letters represent the sides: Front, Back, Up, Down, Left, Right. These can be reversed by an apostrophe (known as a \"prime\" symbol) following it, which makes it turn counter-clockwise. The number 2 following it means to turn the side twice.\n\nFor example, B' means to turn the back side (second image) counter-clockwise. 2R means to turn the right side (last image) twice.\n\nAnd that's all you really need to know about for now. So buckle up and get your cube out, because this is going to be a fun, easy, and relaxing experience. Also, did I forget to mention that there are more than 43 quintillion possible configurations of the Rubik's Cube? OOPS..."
