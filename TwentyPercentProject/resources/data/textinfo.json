		"This demo is showing how to read data from a JSON file easily. JSON is a handy way to store data in a file so that the data is labeled/listed in a way that resembles Java objects and arrays.",
	"instruction1":
		"We're using a JSON parser called Jackson here. Just add all 3 jars from the lib folder into your project.",

		[
			"You can use JSON to store things that look like \"objects\" - these are surrounded by curly brackets in the text file.",
			"You can also store lists (arrays or arraylists). These are surrounded by square brackets in the file.",
			"The main difference is really just whether you want to be able to loop through data, or if you want a text \"name\" for it (like a field)."
